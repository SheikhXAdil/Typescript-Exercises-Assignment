// Sandwiches: Write a function that accepts a array of items a person wants on a sandwich. The function should have one parameter that collects as many items as the function call provides, and it should print a summary of the sandwich that is being ordered. Call the function three times, using a different number of arguments each time.


let make_sandwich = ([...args]:string[]) => {
    console.log("Your order contains the following items:")
    for (let i = 0; i < args.length; i++) {
        const e = args[i];
        console.log(e)
    }
}

make_sandwich(["cheese", "tamato", "chicken", "cucumber"])
console.log("\n")
make_sandwich(["beef", "cheese", "lettuse"])
console.log("\n")
make_sandwich(["beef", "cheese", "olives", "tomatos"])
