// Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

const transportation:string[] = ["motorcycle", "car", "bicycle", "jeep"]
let message_13:string = 'I would like to own a '

for (let i = 0; i < transportation.length; i++) {
    const element = transportation[i];
    console.log(message_13 + element + ".")
}
