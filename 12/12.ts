// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

const friends_12:string[] = ["Daim", "Abdullah", "Soban", "Mouzzam"]
let message_12:string = "You must do something, "
