// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
var friends_12 = ["Daim", "Abdullah", "Soban", "Mouzzam"];
var message_12 = "You must do something, ";
console.log(message_12 + friends_12[0]);
console.log(message_12 + friends_12[1]);
console.log(message_12 + friends_12[2]);
console.log(message_12 + friends_12[3]);
